## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at KAIST, advised by Professor <a href="https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/joon/">Joon Son Chung</a>. My research centers on **multimodal learning**, with a particular focus on deepening the understanding and reasoning capabilities of **multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)**.

I am also passionate about generative modeling in audio, including text-to-audio generation, as well as speech-related tasks such as speech enhancement, source separation, and lip-to-speech synthesis.

## Research Interests

- **Multi-modal large language models**: audio-visual large language models, contrastive-decoding
- **Generative models**: text-to-audio generation, speech enhancement, source separation, lip-to-speech synthesis
