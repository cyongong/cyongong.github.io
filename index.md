## About Me

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at KAIST, advised by Professor 
<a href="https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/joon/">Joon Son Chung</a>. 
My research centers on <strong>multimodal learning</strong>, with a particular focus on deepening the understanding and reasoning capabilities of 
<strong>audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs)</strong>.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
I am also passionate about generative modeling in audio, including text-to-audio generation, as well as speech-related tasks such as speech enhancement, source separation, and lip-to-speech synthesis.
